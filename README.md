## What Elpetozede is...
Elpetozede is a tool to split a wave-File, which e.g. contains the complete side of a audio-record (LP) or a cassette into single wave- or mp3-files for each track.
It searches a Internet-Database (musicbrainz.org) for the album-data, so with a little luck you don't need to type all the track-infos by hand.

## ... and what Elpetozede is NOT
It does NOT help you to record the data from the LP, burn a CD or remove noise from the data. For this purposes, you should better use the common Software, 
e.g. Audacity for recording or iTunes for burning the CD. Currently, this program is not perfect, but it has helped me a lot to transfer my records to CDs or MP3.
